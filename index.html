<h2>ðŸŽ¤ Lyrics: Travis Scott - Sicko mode</h2>
Astro, yeah<br>
Sun is down, freezin' cold<br>
That's how we already know winter's here<br>
My dawg would prolly do it for a Louis belt<br>
That's just all he know, he don't know nothin' else<br>
I tried to show 'em, yeah<br>
I tried to show 'em, yeah, yeah<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
Gone on you with the pick and roll<br>
Young LaFlame, he in sicko mode<br>
Woo, made this here with all the ice on in the booth<br>
At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose<br>
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes<br>
This shit way too big, when we pull up give me the loot<br>
(Gimme the loot)<br>
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose<br>
Had to hit my old town to duck the news<br>
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves<br>
Now it's 4AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew<br>
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice<br>
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits<br>
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose<br>
Some-some-some, someone said<br>
To win the retreat, we all in too deep<br>
P-p-playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak (someone said)<br>
To win the retreat, we all in too deep<br>
P-p-playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak (yeah)<br>
This shit way too formal, y'all know I don't follow suit<br>
Stacey Dash, most of these girls ain't got a clue<br>
All of these hoes I made off records I produced<br>
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group<br>
Hit my esÃ©s, I need the bootch<br>
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo<br>
Told her, "Hop in, you comin' too"<br>
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke<br>
(Don't stop, pop that pussy)<br>
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof (uh)<br>
She said, "Where we goin'?" I said, "The moon"<br>
We ain't even make it to the room<br>
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool<br>
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose<br>
Who put this shit together? I'm the glue (someone said)<br>
Shorty FaceTimed me out the blue<br>
Someone said (playin'-playin' for keeps)<br>
Someone said, motherfuck what someone said<br>
(Don't play us for weak)<br>
Yeah<br>
Astro<br>
Yeah, yeah<br>
Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up (ayy, ayy)<br>
She's in love with who I am<br>
Back in high school, I used to bus it to the dance (yeah)<br>
Now I hit the FBO with duffles in my hands<br>

Had me out like a light, ayy, yeah<br>
Like a light, ayy, yeah<br>

Cut the lights (yeah, what?), paid the price (yeah)<br>
Niggas think it's sweet (nah, nah), it's on sight (yeah, what?)<br>
Nothin' nice (yeah), baguettes in my ice (aww, man)<br>

That's what I like (yeah), that's what we like (yeah)<br>
Lost my respect, you not a threat<br>
When I shoot my shot, that shit wetty like I'm Sheck (bitch)<br>
See the shots that I took (ayy), wet like I'm Book (ayy)<br>
Wet like I'm Lizzie, I be spinnin' Valley<br>
Circle blocks 'til I'm dizzy (yeah, what?)<br>
Like where is he? (Yeah, what?)<br>
No one seen him (yeah, yeah)<br>

She's in love with who I am<br>
Back in high school, I used to bus it to the dance<br>
